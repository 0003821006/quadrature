    The Accelerate framework developed by Apple Inc. provides many APIs, including those for linear algebra (BLAS and LAPACK) and quadrature.<br>
    However, using the quadrature API can be difficult.<br>
    Finally, a sample program for quadrature was found at  <a href="https://face2d.com/apple/accelerate/Quadrature/-/tree/master">https://face2d.com/apple/accelerate/Quadrature/-/tree/master</a>.
