    The Accelerate framework developed by Apple Inc. provides many APIs, including those for linear algebra (BLAS and LAPACK) and quadrature.<br>
    You can figure out how to use Accelerate's BLAS and LAPACK by following the references in Accelerate.h.<br>
    However, using the quadrature API was difficult.<br>
    Fortunately, a sample program for quadrature can be found at <a href="https://face2d.com/apple/accelerate/Quadrature/-/tree/master">https://face2d.com/apple/accelerate/Quadrature/-/tree/master</a>.
